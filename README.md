# Latent-Playground
A Max for Live device based on **mcs.nn~** for real-time latent interaction in Ableton.
Use it to manipulate latent variables by create repetitive trajectories with seed based noises like perlin, voronoi, fractal or simplex. Recover weights of the neural network and bend it by drawing or generating classical distributions that share the same statistics.   


## Important
- Be sure to keep the folder structure intact to ensure correct loading.
- The mcs.nn~ object used in this project is a modified one, so use the one provided. 
- It has been compiled for ARM based Mac, you'll need to get the source code if you want to use it with Intel ARM Mac or Windows. You can access it here : [mcs.nn_tilde_bending](https://github.com/LucasBrgt/mcs.nn_tilde_bending_MaxMSP)


## Prerequisites
- Ableton Live 12 Suite
